## Final Project

In this module, you'll put everything you've learned so far into action! You'll apply a problem-solving framework to tackle a challenging final project: implementing a script that will generate a report of users currently logged in to a set of machines. You'll formulate a problem statement to understand the challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how you intend to solve the problem. Lastly, you'll write the code to implement your solution!

### Some Important Instructions
- The script should take a list of Event objects as input and output a list of strings, one for each machine, in the following format: \
"machine: user1, user2, ...".
- Also, if a machine has no users logged in, it should not be included in the output.

### Key Concepts

* Tackle more complex problems from the ground up using a framework
* Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
* Conduct research into options for tackling the problem
* Plan an approach to solving the problem
* Write a complex script in order to implement a solution
