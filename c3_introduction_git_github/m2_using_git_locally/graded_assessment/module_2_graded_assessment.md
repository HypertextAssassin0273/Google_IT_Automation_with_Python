### Question 1
What is the purpose of a Git repository, and how does it facilitate version control?

- A Git repository is a secure backup of a software project and serves as a redundant storage solution for critical files.
- A Git repository is used to store the final, production-ready version of a software project and ensures that it is readily available for deployment.
- A Git repository is a storage location for software documentation, such as user manuals and guides, and it helps in organizing project documentation.
- **A Git repository is a version control system that tracks changes to source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate, review changes, and maintain a complete history of project revisions.**

### Question 2
When you want to isolate and work on new features or changes without impacting the main branch, which Git command is typically used to create a new branch? 

- git merge new-branch
- git commit new-branch
- **git branch new-branch**
- git pull new-branch

### Question 3
What Git command is used to revert a specific commit, effectively undoing the changes introduced by that commit, while still keeping a record of the undo operation in the Git history?

- git checkout
- git reset
- **git revert**
- git commit --amend

### Question 4
When collaborating with a team on a Git project, what is the main purpose of a remote repository? 

- To store individual team member's versions of the project
- To keep the final version of the project after all changes are incorporated
- To maintain backup copies of the project
- **To function as a central repository where all team members can push and pull changes**

### Question 5
Which of the following statements are true about merging in Git? Select all that apply.

- **Merged changes can be undone using the git revert command.**
- **Merging always creates a new commit.**
- **Conflicts may occur during merging.**
- **Merging cannot be performed on detached HEAD.**

### Question 6
Which Git command is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository and merge them into your current branch?

- git push
- git branch
- git checkout
- **git pull**

### Question 7
In a Git repository, what command is typically used to combine changes from a shared feature branch into another when you want to integrate new features or fixes?

- git log
- git checkout
- **git merge**
- git add

### Question 8
In the labâ€™s Git operation, what does the "git merge improve-output" command achieve?

- It reverts all changes made in the improve-output branch.
- It deletes the improve-output branch.
- It creates a new branch named "improve-output" based on the master branch.
- **It combines the changes from the improve-output branch into the master branch.**

### Question 9
When would you typically create a new branch in a Git repository?

- **To work on a new feature or bug fix without disrupting the main code**
- To merge all changes into the main branch
- To permanently delete code that is no longer needed
- To automatically synchronize with remote repositories

### Question 10
In Git, what is the primary purpose of creating a new branch?

- To delete unwanted code changes
- To merge all changes immediately
- **To isolate experimental changes from the main codebase**
- To create a backup copy of the code
